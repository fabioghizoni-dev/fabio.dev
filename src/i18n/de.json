That's why I'm passionate about technology, a very broad and fascinating field. I'm a full-stack developer, creating intuitive and dynamic interfaces with interactivity and accessibility. My main experience is in web development, but I've also built desktop and mobile applications. I graduated with a degree in Systems Analysis and Development, and I'm now seeking to learn more about various technologies such as Python, Kotlin, Swift, React Native, and others."
