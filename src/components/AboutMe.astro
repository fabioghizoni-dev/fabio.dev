      Hello!! My name is Fábio, I'm {calculateAge("2005-05-30")} years old, and I
      live in Manoel Ribas, Paraná - Brazil. I'm a very curious guy who enjoys learning
      how everything works. That's why I'm passionate about technology, which is a
      very broad and interesting field. I'm a full-stack developer, creating intuitive
      and dynamic interfaces with interactivity and accessibility. My main experience
      is in the web, but I've also developed desktop and mobile applications. I graduated
      with a degree in Systems Analysis and Development and am now seeking to learn
      more about various technologies, such as Python, Kotlin, Swift, React Native,
      and more.
